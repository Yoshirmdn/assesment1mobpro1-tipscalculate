    <string name="copyright">Tip Calculator is an application designed to help users
        calculate the total amount of payment including service charge
        or tip quickly and accurately. This application is very useful
        in various situations, such as eating at a restaurant, ordering
        transportation services, or giving tips to other service workers.
        By using this application, users do not need to calculate tips
        manually, thus avoiding accidental miscalculations.
